\section{Models, Response \& Predictors}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Define: Prediction and Forecast}

\qu{statement about an uncertain event}, \pause
\qu{informed guess or opinion} \\~\\

\textbf{predict (v.)} 1620s (implied in predicted), "\textit{foretell, prophesy}," a back formation from prediction or else from Latin praedicatus, past participle of praedicere "foretell, advise, give notice,"\\~\\

\textbf{forecast (n.)} early 15c., "\textit{forethought, prudence}," probably from forecast (v.). Meaning "conjectured estimate of a future course" is from 1670s. \\~\\

I will be using predict and forecast interchangeably.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Examples}

We make predictions all the time, saying things like: \\~\\

\begin{itemize}
\item \qu{Apple stock will go up tomorrow},
\item \qu{This condo will sell for \$500K}
\end{itemize}

and sometimes unknowingly

\begin{itemize}
\item \qu{Going skiing this weekend will make me happy}, \\~\\
\end{itemize}

How do we make predictions? \pause We use a \textit{model}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Define: model}

Model: a functional decription of a system  \pause \\~\\ An example model is:

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
\end{quotation}

\ingrey{aphorism: (2) a concise statement of a scientific principle (and scientific principles are \textit{models} of the observable universe)} \\~\\

All models have \textbf{input(s)} and \textbf{output(s)}. In the model above, what are the... \\~\\

Inputs? \pause bedtime schedule, waking schedule, ... \\
Outputs? \pause health, wealth and wisdom \\~\\

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Synonyms for Inputs and Outputs}

\small
Here, the inputs and outputs are 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{features} 
\item \textit{attributes} 
\item \textit{characteristics}
\item \textit{variables} / \textit{variates}
\end{itemize}

of a person. A person features health, a person has the characteristic of going to bed early. \\~\\


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{What are \qu{observations}?}

Here, we have features of a person. Generally, inputs and outputs are features of the 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{observation} or 
\item \textit{unit} or 
\item \textit{record} or 
\item \textit{object} or 
\item \textit{subject}.
\end{itemize} 

%\ingray{Note: I will be using \qu{observation} or the name of the unit itself: \qu{person}, \qu{car}, etc.} Here, the observation is a person.

Thus the model relates some \textit{feature(s) of the observation} to other \textit{feature(s) of the observation}. Here, we are relating specific people's bedtime schedule and waking schedule to their health, wealth and wisdom.
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}\frametitle{Ambiguity of Models Defined by Words}

\small
Models phrased in language such as:

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
\end{quotation}

are usually ambiguous, imprecise, vague and ill-defined. Why? \pause 

\begin{itemize}
\item What does \qu{early to bed} mean? 
\item What does \qu{early to rise} mean? 
\item What does \qu{healthy} mean? 
\item What does \qu{wealthy} mean? 
\item What does \qu{wise} mean?
\end{itemize}

Without resolving these ambiguities, \pause the model is unusable and of course, untestable. \\~\\ \pause
\vspace{-0.3cm}

In order to make this precise and defined, there is a necessity to use numbers. \pause Thus, features of the observation must be \textit{measured} (to be defined later). \pause 
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{The Model as a Functional Relationship}

\small

Thus the model relates some \textit{measured feature(s) of the observation} to other \textit{measured feature(s) of the observation}. The relationship is a function taking in inputs (within the parentheses) and \qu{returning} the outputs (the equal sign). For any observation,

\beqn
\substack{\text{the measured} \\ \text{outputs of an} \\ \text{observation}} = \text{model}\parens{\substack{\text{the measured} \\ \text{inputs of an} \\ \text{observation}}}
\eeqn

\ingrey{It is traditional to put the outputs on the left hand side.} This is assumed that the outputs were measured. This type of observation is called 

\begin{itemize}
\item old or
\item historical or
\item known
\end{itemize}

and predictions here are not needed (obviously). In our aphorism model, for the observation being a known person named Joe:

\tiny 
\beqn
\threevec{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's health}}{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's wealth}}{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's wisdom}} = \text{model}\parens{\threevec{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's bedtime}}{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's waketime}}{\vdots}}
\eeqn
\normalsize

	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Updated Definition of Prediction}

\small 
Now we can hone our definition of prediction. For a 

\begin{itemize}
\item new or
\item heretofore unseen or
\item future
\end{itemize}

observation, where the inputs have been measured / assessed but the output has not been measured / assessed,

\beqn
\underbrace{\substack{\text{the \emph{guessed}} \\ \text{output} \\ \text{measurements}}}_{\text{prediction}} = \text{model}\parens{\substack{\text{the measured} \\ \text{inputs of an} \\ \text{observation}}}
\eeqn

\tiny 
\beqn
\threevec{\text{a guessed quantity of Bob's health}}{\text{a guessed quantity of Bob's wealth}}{\text{a guessed quantity Bob's wisdom}} = \text{model}\parens{\threevec{\text{a measured quantity of Bob's bedtime}}{\text{a measured quantity of Bob's waketime}}{\vdots}}
\eeqn
\normalsize

%square brackets denote vector notation with each element indicating a separate dimension.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Measurements as Variables}

Instead of \qu{a measured quantity ...} we can use algebraic \textit{variables} to denote the numerical quantities. It is traditional to use $x$'s to represent inputs and $y$'s to represent outputs. Here would be the relationship for Joe:


\beqn
\threevec{y_1}{y_2}{y_3} = \text{model}\parens{\threevec{x_1}{x_2}{\vdots}}
\eeqn

and for Bob:


\beqn
\threevec{\yhat_1}{\yhat_2}{\yhat_3} = \text{model}\parens{\threevec{x_1}{x_2}{\vdots}}
\eeqn

We will use the \qu{hat} symbol ($\hat{~}$) to indicate a prediction of the output $\yhat$ to distinguish it from a known value of the output $y$.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{More Vocabulary}

\small
Even though measured inputs and outputs are features of an observation, they each go by special names that emphasize their roles. \\~\\

Each output $y$ is called a

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{response} (the model \qu{responds} to inputs)
\item \textit{outcome} / \textit{outcome metric} (the result of inputs)
\item \sout{\textit{endpoint}} (only used in clinical trial context)
\end{itemize}

and they are the target of prediction --- what we want to ultimately predict. \\~\\

Inputs $x$'s then can go by the following terms of art:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{covariates} (because the vary with the response, co-vary)
\item \textit{predictors} (since they will be the inputs used to make predictions)
\end{itemize}

and they are what we make use of to predict. I will try to use \qu{response} and \qu{predictors} in this course.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Mathematical Model}

Now that we have predictors and responses measured an numeric and an equal sign relating them. We have officially created a \textit{mathematical model}. The word \qu{model} now will be represented as a function, $f$. So for an old observation,

\beqn
\threevec{y_1}{y_2}{y_3} = f\parens{x_1, x_2, \ldots} 
\eeqn

and for a new observation,

\beqn
\threevec{\yhat_1}{\yhat_2}{\yhat_3} = f\parens{x_1, x_2, \ldots} 
\eeqn

It is said that the \qu{model explains the response}. What does this mean?
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Science is based on Mathematical Models}

We have become quite successful at shrink-wrapping interesting variables in the world around us

\beqn
F
\eeqn
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Focus: models with univariate responses.}

Although general models have any number of outputs, this semester we will only consider models with one output. Thus, we will be looking at models such as

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy.
\end{quotation}

We picked the most interesting output. So, for an old observation,

\beqn
y = f\parens{x_1, x_2, \ldots} 
\eeqn

and a new observation,

\beqn
\yhat = f\parens{x_1, x_2, \ldots} 
\eeqn

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Many possible models}

\small
\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy.
\end{quotation}

What is the response metric? \pause What does \qu{healthy} mean?\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Healthy for his whole life? Unlikely the model means this...
\item Healthy for ages 25-65? Since we can expect health in infanthood and adolescence but not in elderly years
\end{itemize}

One also gets a feeling from the wording, there is either \qu{healthy} or \qu{not healthy}. Thus the response metric will be the \textit{categorical} data type and the model would be called a \textit{classification} model. \\\vspace{0.2cm}

Categorical measurements consist of discrete, mutually exclusive \textit{levels}. Here, \{healthy, not healthy\}. Generally, \{a, b, c, $\ldots$\}. Metrics with a large number of levels are difficult to model --- keep it low.\\\vspace{0.2cm}

I there are two levels, it is called \textit{binary} or \textit{dichotomous} and the model would be called a \textit{binary response model} (or a classification) with elements 0 and 1.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Define the response clearly}

Response: Healthy for ages 25--65 \\~\\

We still need a clear definition. Ideas? How about: healthy means no incidence of a \qu{major} disease between the ages of 25--65? This can be assessed with medical records. 
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Define the predictors clearly}

$x_1$: bedtime schedule \\~\\

Definition? \pause Average bedtime. \pause How to measure / assess? Survey? \\~\\	

%Difficult... Other ideas? How about bedtimes for every single night from ages 25--65? 14,965 features. Bad idea...


$x_2$: waketime schedule \\~\\	

Definition? \pause Average time to rise in the morning assessed via survey\\~\\	

Thus, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are a variant of a \textit{timestamp} data type.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Dataframes}

\small
The historical \textit{data frame} or \textit{dataset} or even more colloquially, the \qu{data} looks like:

\begin{table}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
Healthy? 1 = yes ($y$) & Average Bedtime ($x_1$) & Average Waketime ($x_2$) \\ \hline
1 & 9:32PM & 6:42AM \\
0 & 11:55PM & 7:53AM \\
0 & 10:33PM & 7:02AM \\
\vdots
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Dataframes have $n$ observations and $p$ predictors. Here $n = \pause 3$ (only those viewable above) and $p = 2$. Thus, it is a matrix with $n$ rows and $p + 1$ columns. The \qu{+1} is for the response which is not a predictor. \\

What would a new observation look like? Tony went to bed on average 9:53PM and awoke on average at 6:13AM. Did he have a healthy life or not?

We don't know the model yet...
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Mathematical Models are Deterministic}

\small
\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy.
\end{quotation}

which, after measuring inputs and outputs and mathematizing, becomes $y = f(x_1, x_2)$.\\

\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
\footnotesize
From the wording, it seems the model is unequivocal and deterministic. This means \pause that for any input values (the measured values of $x_1$ and $x_2$), the output (the response) will have only one unique value.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Thus the functional form likely looks like a \textit{decision tree model}.
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Is the Model \textit{Really} Deterministic?}

This is an ancient question... it touches on the free will vs. determinism debate. We will punt on the philosophy and ask: is this model deterministic? \pause NO. \\~\\

Thus, this model is wrong. Why? We can find at least one person who does not have a matching response when inputs are evaluated in $f$. Seems obvious but...

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Smoking and Lung Cancer}

\small
Consider the model with the binary input 

\begin{itemize}
\item[$y$:] contract lung cancer at some point (1) or not (0)
\item[$x_1$:] smoke 10 pack years or more at some point in a lifetime (1) or not (0) and the response 
\end{itemize}

Do you think the model should look like the below?\vspace{-0.2cm}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.4in]{smoking}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
No... in fact \qu{only} 16\% of smokers get lung cancer compared to about 0.4\% of non-smokers. Thus, the simpel model above is wrong because some responses (that is features of certain individuals) will not \qu{fit} the model. Thus, should we throw out the whole enterprise of modeling?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Statistical Models}

Mathematical models such as

\beqn
y = f(x_1, x_2, \ldots)
\eeqn

can become more forgiving to errors in $f$ by allowing for $Y$ to be modeled non-deterministically as a random variable (r.v.), uppercase $Y$. For our case of binary classification, this r.v. is the Bernoulli:

\beqn
Y \sim \bernoulli{f(x_1, x_2, \ldots)} := \begin{cases} 
1 ~~\text{with probability~} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots) \\
0 ~~\text{otherwise}
\end{cases} 
\eeqn

Since the response is now a r.v., we call this a \emph{statistical model}.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{A Statistical Model}

A more conceivable model $f$ is:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{stat_class_model_health}
\end{figure}

Are there still reasons for $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be rigid binary values e.g. 1 if $x_2 <$ 6:30AM? No... but we haven't spoke about model fits nor parameters.... wait...

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Is Health Dichotomous?}
\small

So, we should really update the text of the aphorism to reflect the introduction of the random variable response. It should read:

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man \emph{more likely to be} healthy.
\end{quotation}

However this seems to still suggest someone is either healthy or not healthy. Didn't the author of the aphorism, to be more accurate, say... 

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man \emph{healthier}.
\end{quotation}

which is deterministic:

\beqn
y = f(x_1, x_2)
\eeqn 

we need some way to measure a quantity of healthiness on a continuous scale. Open problem. How can you shrink-wrap health into a single number? Diversion...

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{QOL: a Response Metric?}

\footnotesize
One such scale is found in \href{http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/6460487}{Flanagan (1978)} invented the precursor to the modern \qu{Quality of Life Scale} (QOLS) metric based on assessing 7-point Likert scales. It takes 5 minutes and scores range from 16--112. Here are the categories:

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{qol_table.png}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Making Up Metrics}

Yes, metrics are essentially \qu{made up}. Good ones are engineered to carefully capture the information sought. Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index}{The Human Freedom Index}
\item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy-Dictatorship_Index}{Democracy-Dictatorship Index}
\item S\&P 500
\item Visual Acuity 20/20, 20/40, etc
\end{itemize}

It is most important for these metrics to be monotonic (i.e. higher always means better or worse). 

We also would appreciate these metrics being approximately linear. So an increase of 1 \qu{point} on the scale means the same increase/decrease in quality. But that is usually too much to ask.


	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Back to Modeling}

We now are considering health as a continuous number (the data type is called \qu{continuous}) but the model is still deterministic. How to we reengineer the aphorism to allow for stochasticity (randomness)?

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man \emph{healthier on average}.
\end{quotation}
	
We can then build a statistical model:

\beqn
Y \sim g\parens{f(x_1, x_2), \sigsq, \ldots}
\eeqn

where $f(x_1, x_2)$ now represents the mean health for these inputs, $\sigsq$ is now variance around that mean, and the ellipses is a technicality dealing with higher moments such as skew, etc that we will ignore for the purposes of this class. Thus, health scores are realized randomly but the mean health scores do not.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Regression Models}

\small
When the response is continuous, the statistical model is called a \textit{regression model}. What does regression mean? Loosely, when you hear regression, you know you're modeling some continuous response (e.g. price, blood pressure, lens power). The typical way these models are written are:

\beqn
Y = f(x_1, x_2) + \errorrv
\eeqn

The equals sign makes us feel like we're back in a deterministic model. But we're not; the $\errorrv$ is a r.v. known as the \qu{noise}. (The British call it the \qu{errors} but that is confusing!) This r.v. necessarily must have no mean, $\expe{\errorrv} = 0$. Can you explain why? \\~\\

Where does $\errorrv$ come from?? Philosophical question... one we will return to soon.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Conditional Expectation}

The model can be written even another way to belabor this point:

\beqn
Y = \cexpe{Y}{x_1, x_2} + \errorrv
\eeqn

where $\cexpe{Y}{x_1, x_2}$ is called the \qu{conditional expectation function} or the \qu{conditional mean function} and of course,

\beqn
\cexpe{Y}{x_1, x_2} = f(x_1, x_2)
\eeqn

What does this look like?
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{A mock $\cexpe{Y}{x_1, x_2}$ Illustration}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.45in]{cef.png}
\end{figure}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Generalizing the Inputs}

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthier on average.
\end{quotation}

The wording \qu{early to bed} and \qu{early to rise} seem to smack of binary inputs. Either it's early or it's late... no in-between values. Again, it's probably not what the original author had in mind.\\~\\ %%%move this above

Let's reengineer the aphorism again to allow for grey area:

\begin{quotation}
\emph{The earlier} to bed and the \emph{earlier to} rise makes a man healthier on average.
\end{quotation}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Bedtime and Waketime Again}

We began with the average bedtime and waketime and recorded it as a datetime.

We now need to use continuous measures for $x_1$ and $x_2$. How can we do this? Should we use 9:42PM, 10:14PM, etc. as before? What is later 11:55PM or 1:02AM?

We should not use timestamps as they fail the monotonicity property that we desire to capture \qu{lateness}.

What should we do? Maybe just one number defined as the number of hours after an absurd average bedtime like 5PM? Thus, 9PM $\rightarrow x_1 = 4$ and 2AM $\rightarrow x_1 = 9$, etc. Ditto for waketime to avoid the problem of people on average waking up after 12:59PM.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{The Average Is Misleading}

We are using average bedtime and waketime. What's wrong with an average?

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{two_dist}
\end{figure}

%par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
%res = 1000
%xs = 5 + seq(-4, 4, length.out = res)
%plot(5 + xs, dnorm(xs, 5, 1), type = 'l', xlab = '', ylab = '')
%plot(5 + xs, dnorm(xs, 5, 0.25), type = 'l', xlab = '', ylab = '')
%
	
These are two bedtime distributions over many, many years. They both have the same average: 10PM. Who do you think is healthier on average? The person on the right. Why?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Designing Better Inputs}

\small
How can we get more \qu{information} out of a person's bedtime and waketime that is relevant to predicting health outcomes?

We likely don't know which piece of the distribution will be helpful, so let's just add all the information. Let's bin by maybe 20min and record the probabilities over many years of being in that bin. For instance, 5 year bins for these two people may look like:

%par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
%n = 5 * 365
%x1 = rnorm(n, 5, 1)
%x2 = rnorm(n, 5, 0.25)
%hist(x1, prob = TRUE, xlim = c(1,9), xlab = 'bedtimes', ylab = 'probability density estimate', main = '')
%hist(x2, prob = TRUE, xlim = c(1,9), xlab = 'bedtimes', ylab = 'probability density estimate', main = '')
%	

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{two_hists}
\end{figure}

All bin values can be used as inputs. So in this model, $p > 2$. It could be almost 100.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Flexible Inputs $p=2 \rightarrow p \approx 100$}

\begin{itemize}
\item Advantage: We can fit more exact rules like if the proportion of times went to bed past 1AM is 10\% ... then health drops considerably and then more so for 2AM
\item Disadvantage: It makes the model hard to fit and interpret. There are a lot of \qu{degrees of freedom} now (a term you've heard before). A lot more in this later as this is the most important topic in this course.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Summary}

Models relate inputs to outputs. Inputs and outputs are measurements or assessments on objects / observations.  Here, we consider only one output and name it the response. All the inputs we then consider to be predictors that explain the response via the model $f$. 

Data frames have rows that are observations and columns that are predictors (with one column that is a response). 

Each predictor and the response have a certain data type. If the data type of the response is categorical (or binary as in two categories), we have a classification model. If the data type of the response is a continuous metric, we have a regression model.

\end{quotation}

We, as a people, built this model and it's been validated over centuries. How did we build it?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Humans as Model Builders}

Likely, many individuals independently \textit{observed} people (the unit of observation), assessed both $y$, their healthiness level over their lives and \emph{assessed / measured all features and noted that} their $x_1, x_2$ bedtime and waketime habits were related via a simple pattern relating these inputs to the response.

\begin{figure}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{How does this work?}

We notice phenomena around ourselves we wish to explain. For example, a person...

\begin{itemize}
\item ... gets a job at Citadel Capital or not
\item ... gets a mortgage approved or not
\item ... runs a mile in $t$ minutes
\item ... has a degree of healthiness (in our aphorism example)
\end{itemize}

We then pore through the \textit{raw, naturally represented data}. What kind of information is this??\\~\\

Everything we notice about the people we observe! Imagine every encounter with the person for years and years (10 minutes here, 5 minutes there), full video clips, audio recordings, smells, touches, tastes, everything.\\~\\

How many measurements is that? (What's the dimensionality of the input space?) Immeasurable and cannot be defined. But we know it's HUGE! Note: this is technically called \emph{deep learning}.

\item The model cannot be communicated precisely.
\item The inputs are too complicated.
\item The functional form cannot be shared.
\item And thus no prediction can be made with it (unless it is the same brain that makes the prediction that built the model).
\end{itemize}

%The sciences … make models. By a model is meant a … construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work. – John von Neumann (1903–1957), 

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Models we are Good and Bad At}
\small

We are ...

\begin{block}{Good at Building Statistical Models when...}
the number of variables that truly matter is small and there's low noise. For example: recognizing the face of your friend, understanding speech, etc.
\end{block}
	
\begin{block}{Bad at Building Statistical Models when...}
inputs are already derivative features of the raw data representation, are numeric and there a lot of them ($p$ large), and noise is large ($\var{\errorrv} >> 0$). For example, everything we will likely do for the rest of the semester.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{We are Frequently Bad...}

Famous finding: Paul Meehl in 1954 found when comparing predictions from a panel of clinicians with PhD's and predictions with a linear model (a simple statistical model), he found the linear model beat the PhD's.

When one is dealing with human lives and life opportunities, it is immoral to adopt a mode of decision-making which has been demonstrated repeatedly to be either inferior in success rate...
\end{quotation}

The clinicians make a diagnosis on the basis of a quick meeting and a whole bunch of numeric variables: age, serum glucose, blood pressure, symptom measurements... difficult models for us to build.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Can we Use Artificial Intelligence (AI)?}

Can we use computers to build models, especially the models we're bad at?

Luckily, yes. And this is a main advantage of artificial intelligence.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{What Does Input to AI Look Like?}

Let's return to our model:\\

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy.
\end{quotation}

We observe every encounter with the person for years and years (10 minutes here, 5 minutes there), full video clips, audio recordings, smells, touches, tastes, everything.\\~\\

Can we enter all this into a computer? No, not now, possibly not ever. Also, willl be using statistical modeling so it needs well-defined measurements. So we need to \qu{featurize} and then \qu{collect data}.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{What is Featurization / Data Collection?}

What is featurization? Deciding predictors. What is data collection? Sampling Collecting the values of the predictors.

\section{Correlation  $\not \Rightarrow$  Causation}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{A \qu{Causal} Model}

\begin{quotation}
The earlier to bed and the earlier to rise \emph{makes} a man healthier on average.
\end{quotation}

What does the language suggest by using the verb \qu{to make}? It suggests that the \qu{earlier to bed and the earlier to rise} \textit{causes} \qu{a man [to be] healthier on average}.
