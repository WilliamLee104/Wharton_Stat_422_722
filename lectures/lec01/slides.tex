\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Define: Prediction and Forecast}

\qu{statement about an uncertain event}, \pause
\qu{informed guess or opinion} \\~\\

\textbf{predict (v.)} 1620s (implied in predicted), "\textit{foretell, prophesy}," a back formation from prediction or else from Latin praedicatus, past participle of praedicere "foretell, advise, give notice,"\\~\\

\textbf{forecast (n.)} early 15c., "\textit{forethought, prudence}," probably from forecast (v.). Meaning "conjectured estimate of a future course" is from 1670s. \\~\\

I will be using predict and forecast interchangeably.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Examples}

We make predictions all the time, sayomg things like: \\~\\

\begin{itemize}
\item \qu{Apple stock will go up tomorrow},
\item \qu{This condo will sell for \$500K}
\end{itemize}

sometimes unknowingly

\begin{itemize}
\item \qu{Going skiing this weekend will make me happy}, \\~\\
\end{itemize}

How do we make predictions? \pause We use a \textit{model}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Define: model}

\qu{a functional decription of a system}  \pause \\~\\ An example model is:

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise make a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
\end{quotation}

All models have \textbf{input(s)} that are then somehow related to its \textbf{output(s)}. What are the input(s) and output(s) above? \\~\\

Inputs: \pause bedtime schedule, waking schedule \\
Outputs: \pause health, wealth and wisdom \\~\\

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Observations and their Features}

\small
Here, the inputs and outputs are 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{features} or 
\item \textit{attributes} or 
\item \textit{characteristics} of
\end{itemize}

a person. \\~\\

Generally, inputs and outputs are features of the 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{unit of analysis} or 
\item \textit{the observation} or 
\item \textit{the subject}.
\end{itemize} 

%\ingray{Note: I will be using \qu{observation} or the name of the unit itself: \qu{person}, \qu{car}, etc.} Here, the observation is a person.

Thus the model relates some \textit{feature(s) of the observation} to other \textit{feature(s) of the observation}. Here, we are relating specific people's bedtime schedule and waking schedule to their health, wealth and wisdom.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Features as Measurements}
Models phrased in language such as:

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise make a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
\end{quotation}

are usually ambiguous, imprecise, vague and ill-defined. Why? \pause What does \qu{early to bed} mean? What does \qu{early to rise} mean? What does \qu{healthy} mean? What does \qu{wealthy} mean? What does \qu{wise} mean? Without resolving these ambiguities, \pause the model is unusable and of course, untestable. \\~\\ \pause

In order to make this precise and defined, there is a necessity to use numbers. \pause Thus, features of the observation must be \textit{measured} (to be defined later). \pause Thus the model relates some \textit{measured feature(s) of the observation} to other \textit{measured feature(s) of the observation}.  
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{The Model as a Functional Relationship}

\small
The relationship is a function taking in inputs (within the parentheses) and \qu{returning} the outputs (the equal sign). For any observation that is:

\beqn
\substack{\text{the measured} \\ \text{outputs of an} \\ \text{observation}} = \text{model}\parens{\substack{\text{the measured} \\ \text{inputs of an} \\ \text{observation}}}
\eeqn

It is traditional to put the outputs on the left hand side. This is assumed that the outputs were measured. This type of observation is called 

\begin{itemize}
\item old 
\item historical
\item known
\end{itemize}

In our aphorism model, for the observation being a known person named Joe:

\tiny 
\beqn
\threevec{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's health}}{\text{a measured quantity of Bob's wealth}}{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's wisdom}} = \text{model}\parens{\twovec{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's bedtime}}{\text{a measured quantity of Joe's waketime}}}
\eeqn
\normalsize

	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Updated Definition of Prediction}

\small 
Now we can hone our definition of prediction. For a 

\begin{itemize}
\item new 
\item heretofore unseen 
\item future
\end{itemize}

observation, where the inputs have been measured / assessed but the output has not been measured / assessed,

\beqn
\underbrace{\substack{\text{the \emph{guessed}} \\ \text{output} \\ \text{measurements}}}_{\text{prediction}} = \text{model}\parens{\substack{\text{the measured} \\ \text{inputs of an} \\ \text{observation}}}
\eeqn

\tiny 
\beqn
\threevec{\text{a guessed quantity of Bob's health}}{\text{a guessed quantity of Bob's wealth}}{\text{a guessed quantity Bob's wisdom}} = \text{model}\parens{\twovec{\text{a measured quantity of bedtime}}{\text{a measured quantity of waketime}}}
\eeqn
\normalsize

%square brackets denote vector notation with each element indicating a separate dimension.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Measurements as Variables}

Instead of 

\begin{quotation}
Early to bed and early to rise make a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
\end{quotation}

we have



Instead of \qu{a measured quantity ...} we can use an algebraic \textit{variable} (e.g. the symbol $x$) to denote the numerical quantity and now we have:

 \beqn
\threevec{\yhat_1}{\yhat_2}{\yhat_3} = \text{model}\parens{\twovec{x_1}{x_2}}
\eeqn

We will use the hat symbol ($\hat{~}$) to indicate a prediction. 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Mathematical Model}

Now that we have numbers and an equal sign, we have now created a \textit{mathematical model} where the \textit{model} now will be represented as a function, $f$ where the inputs and outputs are specified implicitly.

 \beqn
\threevec{\yhat_1}{\yhat_2}{\yhat_3} = f\parens{x_1, x_2}
\eeqn
